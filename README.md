## Symphony, the harmonius MUD codebase
Symphony is a modern MUD codebase. The inspiration comes from the Rom-family of MUDs, and the user
experience inherits from that style of play. The primary project goal is **extensibility** in both
form and function. It should be simple and intuitive to customize the interface, extend and modify
the feature set, and create new content. This is achieved by maintaining a minimally complex core
and implementing as much of the game as possible through a robust module system. Some other
engineering considerations include, in no particular order:

 * test coverage
 * security
 * code quality
 * performance
 * ease of maintenance
 * documentation
 * simplicity
