# Symphony MUD
Symphony MUD is a modern, extensible, open source MUD server codebase intended as a replacement for the Diku/Merc/ROM line of games. See the [announcement][announcement] for details.

## Getting Started
Symphony MUD is built, tested, and hacked in a [Vagrant][vagrant] virtual machine. If you're familiar with Vagrant, the instructions couldn't be easier:

```bash
# Clone the repository.
git clone https://github.com/cmtonkinson/symphonymud
cd symphonymud
# Bring in submodules.
git submodule init
git submodule update
# Log in to the virtual machine.
vagrant up
vagrant ssh
# Compile the source.
make
# Boot Symphony MUD.
bin/symphony
```

If you're not familiar with Vagrant, you should be (because it's a great tool). Worst case, if you have a Linux system you should be able to get Symphony MUD to compile and run as long as you meet the dependencies (check out [provision.sh](provision.sh) and the [makefile](makefile) for more details).

---
## Detailed Setup
Symphony MUD is developed with clang (using the C++11 standard) on Ubuntu 14.04 x64 with the 3.13 kernel. `libpcre` and `libsodium` are prerequisites. `libpcre` is used throughout the code for various string manipulation, while `libsodium` is at present only used for password storage.

PCRE is installed (as per [provision.sh](provision.sh)) via `apt`, while `libsodium` is included as a submodule which is built and installed using autotools.

`ccache` and `gdb` are used for ease of development and testing, but are not required. Settings for these can be found in the [makefile](makefile) as well as in the additions to `~/.bashrc` made by [provision.sh](provision.sh).

---
## Data
All data is persisted to disk in plain old human readable text format under `data/`. MySQL has been used previously, but turns out not to be a great fit for a MUD. Currently most data is stored in a custom serialization format due to trouble getting a YAML library (particularly, [yaml-cpp][yaml-cpp]) to compile cleanly. A pull request integrating a YAML-based replacement for the current `Storage` class would be accepted enthusiastically.

### Contributors:
Original inspiration for Symphony MUD comes from the excellent (sadly now defunct) ROM-derived *Feudal Realms* by Charles Webber (aka "Turloch"). Some internals take initial inspiration from *Scratch*, a telnet chat server by Jared Devall (aka Rendelven).
